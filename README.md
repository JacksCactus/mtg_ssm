# mtgcdb - Magic: the Gathering Collection Database

[!Build Status(https://travis-ci.org/gwax/mtgcdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gwax/mtgcdb)

This is a set of libraries and command line tools for manipulating magic
card collection information. At it's core, the data is stored in an
sqlite database on your machine.

Card information can be imported from http://mtgjson.com datafiles.

# In development

Collection counts can be imported from csv or Google sheets.

Collection can be exported to csv or Google sheets.

# Warning

**This set of tools is not for the faint of heart.**

You will need some understanding of Python to make use of these tools. This is
how I manage my collection, and I thought it might be worth putting out there
for others to use. If there is time, I may make this more friendly in the
future.
